    <p> 1. My previous experience with coding comes from last semseter where I used HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript
        to develop a ten-page website. 
        <br>
        2. I took a web development class is highschool and Core Interaction 1 last semseter
        <br>
        3. I remember most of the HTML and CSS language that was covered in those classes. 
        <br>
        4. I found difficulty with the JavaScript content. 
        <br> 
        5. I am excited to learn code, however, I am a little nervous about learning JavaScript because I find it a little difficult.
        <br>
        6. I plan on focusing on web development and design in my college education and future career so learning code is crucial for me.
        <br>
        7. I prefer Visual Studio Code.
        <br>
        8. I have used Github before.
        <br>
        9. I would consider HTML as a skeleton, CSS as the skin, and Javascript as the muscle and joints. HTMl is the basic foundation that contains all the information
        that will be displayed on the screen, CSS dictates the decoration and the visual layout of the information, and JavaScript dictates the interactions between the screen
        and user. 
        <br>
